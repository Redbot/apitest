    -- With the new Toggle/Threshold options we added "nosave" if you put nosave at the end of the command it will not save it to the ini

10/28/2023e:
  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Fixed Auras chain casting by stripping the rank off all auras prior to checking the aura window for the buff. This corrects the issue with Circle of Divinity chain casting when you have higher ranks of it. Likely addresses other auras.

10/25/2023d:
  MQ2Mage: |

  MQ2Mage: |
    - GroupModRod will now only be used if UseGroupModRod is on AND we are not more than 5 levels higher than the spell.
    -- GroupModRod is already defaulted false, but people still use it because they are confusing it with the modrod AA
    --- The problem with this is that it hasn't had a new spell since 105, and shares a timer with regular modrod
10/25/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - when byos custom is set or unset, it will now refresh the cwtn ui window

10/24/2023b:
  MQ2Necro: |
    - Corrected issue where we would enter combat when we didn't want to

    -- byos/byos-custom
  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - corrected typo in Brimstone Rune
  MQ2Monk: |

    -- these were moved out of "FK Synergy" since they are not flying kick
    -- they will be in TigerClawT9 (which also is going to include the lower lvl t9 abilities)
    -- Once we get Improved Synergy (105/EoK) we will prefer to use FKSynergy
    --- if you are sub 105, you will use FKSynergy if UseTigerClaw is off, and TigerClawT9 if it is on
  MQ2Mage: |
    - will use Turn Summoned against construct creatures during burns
    - Added PetPromisedHeal usage
    -- byos/byos-custom
  MQ2War: |

10/15/2023:
  MQ2BufMe: |
    - added missing "pluginmsg"
    -- corrects output issue if you're not using cwtn plugins
  MQ2Mage: |

    -- many folks don't realize it is summoning the now inferior "Want of Pelagic" because that spell group hasn't had an update since TDS
10/14/2023b:
  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Remove Thorn Wilting usage
    - you will need to use the other multitude of options and work arounds for mobs with damage shields
    -- it lowers the amount of damage mobs take on YOUR damage shield
    -- it does not lower the amount of damage you take from damage shields.

10/14/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - updating levelmax within the ui window will now update the spawn search

    -- defaulted on due to so many single group / mission users who would want to wtf-splode a singular named mob ASAP

  MQ2Paladin: |
    - AATimerTwo Adjustments
    - Thanks for bringing it backup BlankStare
    -- We will now continue to use FoD and DS when available since no mana cost or cast time
    ---  now that the "no timer" FoD bug/sploit doesn't exist, this change makes good sense

5/25/2023b:
  MQ2Bst: |

5/26/2023:
  MQ2Monk: |
    - We will now only use Shuriken during our combat routine if we're above 20% endurance
    -- Shuriken is pretty low damage, but since we want to squeeze out anything we can, we're going to use it
    -- in certain eras it can cause over usage of endurance due to poor endurance regen and endurance pool during that time.
    -- if we're below lvl 100, we're only going to use Shuriken if we have 20% or more endurance.
    -- thx Raiden1 for bringing it to attention
5/23/2023:

    - Added additional debugging for missing reagents
    -- this came up with some custom EMU servers removing requirements from spells, but MQ still thinks those requirements are valid, will be helpful debugging
    - Added funcionality to check for spawns in radius of our target
    -- This is currently (future) only used for hweee-zaaaard spells
    - Lesson "on demand" example: "/shd lesson"
    -- this doesn't interrupt or stop anything, but means you don't need to remember an "/dgga /alt act 481" and can just "/cwtna lesson"
    - we will now unload easy.lua like we do for mq2melee and afnuke due to conflicting class behaviors.

  MQ2Enchanter: |

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Dicho is now Progressive Spell
    - Cleanup deprecations

    -- this is intended to help with eq server lag in that spell activating making mq/mq2eskay think it isn't casting a spell.

  MQ2Berzerker: |
    - We will now click off reckless Abandon if you are lower than 20% health.
    -- even if paused.
    -- this should help neglectful "drivers" who let their zerkers die a lonely death in the guild hall where due to perma buffs, just sit and slowly gnaw their own legs until they die. alone. lonely. sadly.
5/12/2023:
  CWTN: |

    -- We were already checking you don't have any mobs engaged on you (xtarget),
    --- but now we will additionally check for if we think you are in combat or not
    - Added a check to "resume" our pets, with the new discipline option
    - Added an additional half second delay command for sending in swarm pets
  MQ2Bst: |
    - Temporarily removed VelocityUnity from our CombatSummon
    -- this *appears* to cause issues under certain circumstances that need further checking
  MQ2Eskay: |
    - we will now use Visage of Decay (if death is on cooldown) for burns
    -- we didn't have this in here for ages because we got a dozen opinions on when/how/where it should be used
    -- this has a toggle defaulted to off
    --- if you don't like it or don't want it, or want to do it manually, turn it off
  MQ2War: |
    - No more "UseAlliance" in the CWTN window
    -- if dbg adds a warrior alliance, we'll add it back :p

4/26/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Pause now populates the entire zerker window with the exception of the tabs that can still be clicked while paused. Clicking anywhere else inside the window will unpause.
    -- this should help with the "zomg i can't unpause"

  MQ2Bst: |
      - added additional debug
4/24/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - fixed the fix to fix the broken fix in how we check for spells in your book

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - should fix a potential crash with corpse retrieval
4/22/2023b:
  CWTN: |
    - hotfix crash =p
4/22/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - added an "on demand" output for when the plugin is using an AA by command/hotkey instead of automatically.
    -- example: dashAA, aainvis, etc.
    - Our IsMemorized functions now check for spell against gem spell ID rather than by name
    -- this is because things like "Ring of cobalt scar" are the same name, but different ID/level. Since we are already passing the eq_spell*, we can just check ID without having to do other stuff like store and pass around levels.
    - Updated DumpAggro to use the "On Demand" function
    - cleanup

    - We will now automatically pause on camping out of the game
    -- you will unpause if you get interrupted from camping
    - due to the amount of "zomg sic the plugin is unloaded/paused/deleted and the plugin is still doing stuff" after updates this week, we're going to force unload mq2afnuke like we do for mq2melee

  MQ2Mage: |
    - due to a current, confirmed eq bug that exists during raids, we will now summon lvl 1 "summon dagger" for weapon summoning > if you are in raidmode <.
    -- this is not something that (i) sic is particularly happy about having to change, so please ask your local dbg spy to fix their issues :p
    --- we don't ever kill your pet, so if you need new weapons, kill your pet manually.
    -- this won't be a toggle, and once the bug is corrected and it is no longer a benefit to *not* use proc weapons, we will go back to normal.
    -- if you are not in raidmode, you will use your "regularly scheduled pet weapons"
    --- we don't ever kill your pet, so if you need new weapons, kill your pet manually.

4/19/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Cleanup trailing space usage
    -- This is going to correct spells like Burnout XI? or Canni III etc
    - Consolidate SpellInBook checking
    - Updated DataTempType
    - Misc cleanup
    - Adding some utility commands to allow for manual usage of certain ability/traits
    -- details to come

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Will now check VelocityUnity during combatmem which prevents additional memorizations.

  MQ2Mage: |
    - Renamed "Rampart" line to "Iceflame"
    - Misc spell output cleanup
    - Corrected issue that would give incorrect Burnout spell

  MQ2Necro: |
    - Added the following commands:
    -- added '/nec levant' or '/nec evac' to use "Levant" AA
    -- added '/nec invis' or '/nec cloak' to use "Cloak of Shadows" AA
    -- added '/nec dmf' or '/nec dead man floating' to use "Dead Man Floating" aa
    --- none of these (at least currently) cancel anything or queues to do once finished what they're currently doing
    - We will now only swap to the single Grip or Decay during raidswapdots if they are higher level than our combo dot

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Added additional output in debugrez to remind folks that Rejuvenation of Spirit requires 'fast regen' and not just 'out-of-combat'\
    - Corrected issue that would report the incorrect Cannibalize spell

4/7/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Work towards renaming all class progressive spell groupings to "Progressive Spell"
  MQ2Mage: |
    - renamed "Dissident" to "Progressive Spell"
    - Added an option to not use the class Progression Spell
    -- this is to address an eqbug
    --- we're not going to always provide permanant toggles/options to work around eqbugs
    ---- and this likely will get removed once that bug is fixed.
    -- this option means if you turn it off, we're not going to automemorize anything in that slot
4/2/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixed issue that would make us treat Twincast Aura as if we had twincast (bug)
    -- thx kazimere for report

3/28/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Adjusted our Invalid AA reporting
    -- hopefully no longer report stuff that is clearly actually valid

  MQ2Necro: |
    - Fixed StandOnFeignAtHealth command

3/15/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Summon Companion toggle
    -- Classes with the Summon Companion AA ability can toggle the usage of it.
    --- This is not a UI Window option, this is only a slash command option.
    -- If you turn this off and your pet is stuck under the world because EQ sucks, that is your fault.
    - Note: These automations aren't meant to be "sneaky"
    -- This addition of the Summon Companion toggle is *purely* because of the manacost that was brought up.
    -- If you get declined a guild application because you are using MQ and have been asked not to that is not our fault.
    -- If you get in trouble in your current guild because you are using MQ and have been asked not to, that is also not our fault.
  MQ2Necro: |
    - will no longer try and use bifold if you have heretic's twincast, as it prevents bifold from landing
3/13/2023:
  MQ2Eskay: |
    - UseDeflection toggle
  MQ2Paladin: |
    - UseDeflection toggle
3/9/2023b:

3/9/2023:
  MQ2War: |
    - Corrected glyph issue if not using usefortitude
  MQ2Nec: |
    - added automatic bifold usage
  MQ2Cleric: |
    - corrected Eleventh-Hour bug
2/27/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - added CWTN.SwitchWithMa to match the ui window (CWTN.SwitchWithMA already exists)
    - added CWTN.Pulling
    - Additional DebugDuringPull output enchancements
    - Corrected issue with our target validation
    -- We now handle Target Type "Line of Sight"
  MQ2Mage: |
    - added automatic bifold usage can toggle off with /mag usebifold off
    - made adjustments and improvements to how to check and track twincast uptime/usage
    - the target validation fixes in CWTN Commons corrected an issue trying to cast bolts on mobs we couldn't see
    -- eq only requires LoS for the spell to LAND not for the spell to be cast
    -- these are the "projectile" type spells, where you actually throw something at the mob
    - corrected LoS issue for clicky orb usage (Firebound and Minion)
  MQ2War: |
    - CulmStand is now "StandDisc"
    - if you are tanking and useglyph is on, you will now not pair glyph with StandDisc or with fort
2/22/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - added more information for debugduringpull usage
    - Cleaned up the "Alt Ability Error" message so folks don't think we're asking them to delete their characters.
    - CWTN Type Additions: SetGroupRoles and CheckPriorityTarget
  MQ2Rogue: |
    - fixed an oddball situation that would make Jugular not fire as expected
  MQ2War: |
    - Will no longer use throat jab under 86

2/18/2023:
  MQ2Bst: |
    - fix spam memorization if usemending is on (new bug from 2/17/23)
2/17/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Added the ability to exempt specific spells from having rank checking
    -- this allows spells that cast the incorrect rank if you go silver/bronze/wood/dirt/dogpoo
    --- current examples: velocity lines from bst, Spirit of Siver, Iceflame Barricade, Symbiotic Alliance
  MQ2Bst: |
    - if you have usemending on and are not using alliance, you will put it in your gem13 slot if you have a 13th gem slot
    - Made some adjustments to not check certain spells for rank stripping if you are silver/bronze/wood/dirt rank
    -- this should help proof things like: Velocity Lines, Spirit of Siver, Symbiotic Alliance, etc which don't cast the correct spell if you drop rank
2/15/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Added the ability to designate certain discs to be fired while moving
    -- this is useful and needed for things like escape/endregen combo for mq2rogue
    - Added a "CheckPriorityTarget" option. this is defaulted true so no changes unless you turn it off
    -- this is useful for things like gumdrops or other fights that you don't necessarily want to have to retarget off of the named everytime your target dies.
    - We are no longer going to check for specific triggered effects (buffs)
    -- this has the potential for not allowing certain clicky illusions that give you skeleton illusions
    -- but it will hopefully lower the amount of folks directed towards the FAQ
  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Will now attempt to use Escape/EndRegen combo during battle
    -- Evade requires 2% of your endurance if you end up bleeding out endurance and are too low to use Evade, we obviously can't do that.
  MQ2Eskay: |
    - We will no longer search for any of the following skeletal illusions:
    -- "Skeletal Form", "Mottled Skeletal Form", "Icebone Skeletal Form", "Bloodbone Skeletal Form", "Scorched Skeletal Form", "Spectre Form", or "Illusion: Skeleton"
2/3/2023:
  MQ2Mage: |
    - forced workaround for eq iceflame bug
  MQ2Rogue: |
    - added a toggle for timer12 "Puncture" usage
    -- this allows you to save timer 12 for manual/script usage of the "smoke" line
2/2/2023:
  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Will no longer do Projection of Doom unless you are tanking (in a tankmode or assigned as group main tank)
    -- the usage of this is still a "low health emergency"
  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Will now Ennui on RaidMA in raidmode (need raidmode, assigned raidma, heal/hybrid loadout etc)
    - Will now Growth on RaidMA in raidmode (need raidmode, assigned raidma, usegrowth, etc)
1/31/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - Bow/Throwing pullers should once again turn off autofire on return
    - We will now popup a message if trying to force plugins on unsupported servers
  MQ2Mage: |
    - potential hard-coded work around for Iceflame Barricade eq bug
  MQ2Shaman: |
    - We will no longer "manage" languid bite if useaoe is on
    -- the idea is that if you have UseAoE on and you have languid bite on, that you intend on that.
    -- Languid Bite will still be temporarily toggled off for turgur's virulent swarm usage
1/24/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - there might be duplicate update notes
  MQ2Necro: |
    - fixed issue with summon remains not firing due to a timer issue
    -- added additional comments to the functionality
  MQ2Paladin: |
    - Added lower level "armor of" discs to the Mantle spell group.
    -- these are "armordisc" discs, but it is before they split into timer 5 (mantle) and timer 11 (armordisc)
    -- so we'll just put these in mantle group since the timer is the same
    - Hand of Piety as an additional MA oh shit heal

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Added ProcMod "Weapon Covenant" as a filler burn disc when other stuff is down
1/19/2023:
  MQ2Monk: |
    - Precision fix
    -- for realzies this time, ya'll.
  MQ2Paladin: |
    - Added Holyforge usage during fighting undead
    -- this has a toggle, because it is such a long recast
    -- if you are tanking, you will only use it when your other tanking defensives have already been used
    - Added Pureforge usage
    -- no toggle
    -- if you are tanking, you will only use it when your other tanking defensives have already been used

1/13/2023:
  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Corrected issue that wouldn't use tier'd defensives if you were not using a shield.
    -- this is because of us checking for deflection availability.
    -- huge oversight that has existed in paladin for a few months, and eskay for, like ever.
    -- shoutout to bmck1986 for bringing this up
  MQ2Monk: |
    - - Fixed precision spam trying to fire the previous 3rd precision, when it meant to fire the 4th
  MQ2Paladin: |
    - Corrected issue that wouldn't use tier'd defensives if you were not using a shield.
    -- this is because of us checking for deflection availability.

  CWTN: |
    - another pass at unborking setting puller in a pulling role =p
1/5/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - can now dashaa while invis
    - rogues will hide to use dashaa if they are not hidden (takes ~4 seconds before they can dash after hiding)
  MQ2GroundSpawns: |
    - thx zuesizgod <3
    - Added "ignorecurrent" this allows you to manually ignore a current shiny you are going after
    -- this is for times to temporarily ignore a shiny that might be behind a locked door, or otherwise one you don't want to get get.
1/4/2023:
  CWTN: |
    - added nosave to the following:
    -- burncount
    -- aoecount

    -- campradius
    - removed debugstatement in stickselection
  MQ2Cleric: |
    - corrected visibitliy issue for cleric on DIALL in UI window

    - Fixed the fix (again) to not set puller role in huntertank
  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Removed the requirement of UseChaotic for mental contortion, phantasmal Opponent, and Forceful Rejuve

    -- We appreciate and value all of you (yes even you, you grumpy shitcake)
    -- Thank you for giving us a great 2022, and we look forward to exciting things in 2023
    - group role adjustments will now check to ensure you're not currently casting
    - huntertank will no longer set grouprole as "puller"
    -- this is due to how mercs work (thx GEH for feedback)
  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - AoESlow will now correctly check against or greater than AoECount
12/27/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Allow for the toggle of an ability with slash command that does not save "nosave"
    -- example: "/shd byos nosave"
    --- this would toggle "byos" but and not save to your ini, similar to if you clicked it on the UI window
    - "setgrouproles" toggle option is now available
    -- example: "/shd setgrouproles off"
    -- the purpose of this is to allow you the (temporary) ability to not have the cwtn plugins force your group roles when you enter certain modes
    -- ex: mode 4 would set you to tank/ma group role if you were group leader
    --- there is no INI setting for this, this is a toggle for your current instance of the plugin.
    --- if you reload/relog/restart you will need to toggle it off again.
    --- we intentionally do not want this to be an ini setting or a saved setting, but understand very niche desire to have the ability to toggle it off.
    - corrected some instance where certain modes wouldn't flag you with the respective group role.
    -- example: puller group role for huntertank
    - group role adjustment will now again only be attempted by group leader
  MQ2Necro: |
    - Added missing "Mental Vivisection" to Group ManaTap
  MQ2Rogue: |
    - fixed the fix to fix the jugular/stunstrike fix

    -- future update will allow for a temporary toggle to disable us updating your group roles
  MQ2Rogue: |
    - removed "distraction" from "aggro Reduction",
    -- it isn't the same as the rest of the line, despite being timer 11.
    --- it requires out of combat and hidden, which is not what we're trying to do with aggro reduction line.
    - fixed issue for rk II and rk III jugular strike and stunstrike
12/20/2022:
  MQ2Berzerker: |

    - All the plugins should have all the new abilities
    - There may end up being adjustments for spell lines that got a new combodot, or similar

    -- we will adjust these things as the expansion unfolds.
    - corrected issue that would report a spell error to report to cwtn/sic
  MQ2Eskay: |
    - corrected spell names
  MQ2Bst: |
    - corrected spell names

12/03/2022:

    -- Zan Fi's Whistle is one that was failing, for example.
12/02/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - added trying to automatically handle bad dbg naming
    -- handle if dbg has a trailing space left in a spell name
    -- handle if dbg is missing a space between '.' and 'II/III' in 'Rk. iii' like in "Cantata of Rodcet Rk.iii"
  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - renamed "Reiterate" to "Replication"
    -- this is so it is more clear that UseReplication adjusts this.

    - Corrected a combat memorization issue

    - breathingdot now respects mana min
    - synergy now respects mana min
  MQ2Mage: |

    -- usage of "DS Single" will still only be tank classes
    -- veilDS and skinDS will still remain MA
    - Corrected a combat memorization issue
    - Added a Range Check to Companion's Fury
    -- in the future we'll do that for all pet AA's
    --- however, it is STRONGLY encourage to not be more than 200 from your pet
    --- as you will have a pretty substantial dps loss not being able to fury buff it.
  MQ2Monk: |
    - Will now check your bandolier sets for bandoswap viability when you add/delete bandolier sets.
  MQ2Pal: |

    - Corrected a pet buff check that would prohibit Companion's Fortification from firing.
    - Corrected a pet buff check that would prohibit Protection of the Warder from firing.
    - Added PetBite over PetSpirit for tanking
    -- Keep in mind, UnityVelocity line overwrites PetBite with PetSpirit line, and PetBite does not overwrite PetSpirit line
    --- meaning you will have to block your petSpirit line if you don't want to use the PetSpirit buff
    --- as it gets applied from other abilities.

  MQ2Mage: |
    - Corrected a pet buff check that would prohibit Companion's Aegis from firing.
    - Corrected a pet buff check that would prohibit Companion's Fortification from firing.
    - Corrected a pet buff check that would prohibit Host in the Shell from firing.

  MQ2Necro: |
    - This is the first live patch where MQ2Necro is "full-release"
    - The RG Launcher is unable to *delete* old files.
    -- This means you will get an error box if you didn't

    --- c: change your macroquest.ini to MQ2Necro=0 under Plugins


  MQ2War: |
    - If you have useFort turned on, we will now use fort as the first defensive burn in addition to previous usage
    -- previously it would only get used as a last "oh shit" if you didn't have anything else up
    --- but that usually means you died and got brought back in while you didn't have other defensive burns available.
    -- you can still turn off usefort if you don't want to use it

10/19/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Added additional mez animations
    -- this should help in places like vergalid mines

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Added ability to adjust at what personal health you lifetap at.
    -- This is defaulted and *intended* to be 100.
    -- but there are circumstances like: not planning on tanking, lower level, mana issues, wanting to do dots (w/ byos/byoscustom)
    -- where adjusting it to less than 100 would provide more benefit and flexibility in casting other abilities

  MQ2Necro: |
    - Official Release!

  CWTN: |
    - fixed typo with empowered campfire command output

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Chaotic line now checks for max mez level when using it for twincast (it already does for mezzing)
    - if we're in combat, but we have disempowering aura set to be used (And is memorized), then recast it if we need to
    -- this is for "Special circumstances" where you need to keep up this aura
    -- we're not going to combat memorize and/or anything like that
    --- but if we have it currently memorized, we're assuming we want to keep it active if it drops

  MQ2Necro: |
    - Will go to "paid release" on 10/19/2022 patch

  MQ2Paladin: |
    - cure enchancements
    - Will go to "paid release" on 10/19/2022 patch

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - You should no longer be able to try and save a invalid loadout number
    - ex: "/shm loadout 4" will tell you that it is invalid.

  MQ2War: |
    - Cleaned up some AA usage to ensure we have buff slots if it is going to give us a buff
    -- this helps prevent a situation when in raid and you start spamming an AA to try fire it, but can't because your buffs are full
    --- looking at you "shadow of buffslot taking"
    - Rage of rallos zek now fires during burns for dps or for tanking
    - War's sheol's now fires during burns for dps or for tanking
    - Imperator's command now fires for dps or for tanking

10/02/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - the cwtn window title will now reflect the plugin's build date and not the cwtn commons library build date.
    -- this means if a plugin, like mq2paladin, was rebuilt, but commons wasn't, then it would now update the correct date.
    - We will now automatically set your fps/bgfps to 30 if they are below this setting
    -- you can turn this setting off with AdjustLowFPSSetting off

    -- we won't fd in manual mode
    -- etc
    - We will only use Death's Effigy if you have a camp or usemelee turned on.
    -- this is so you will break invis when you would normally do so
  MQ2Paladin: |
    - useblessing command now adjusts useblessing
    -- wow, amazing, 10/10, a+, gold star!
9/26/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - removed arcane secrets from glyph usage
    -- power and secrets being on the same timer can result in a situation where we fire secrets early
    -- and also prevent from being able to use power again later if we had puchased another power
  MQ2Paladin: |
    - Made adjustments to epic usage
  MQ2Shaman: |
    - you can now adjust at what health you want to stop dotting on named/non-named

    -- if you have this memorized, you obviously want to use it early in your rotation
    - Added UsePreservation toggle
    - Added UseStance toggle
    - Splash/brilliant changes for twincast:
    -- if splash is memorized (be it byos, custom-byos, memsplash etc) and SplashCureOnly is off, brilliant as usual.
    -- if you don't have splash memorized, brilliant as usual
    -- if SplashCureOnly (and memorized) we won't check if we can brillant outside of when we're going to try and use splash
    --- for curing or twincasting it

9/23/2022:
  MQ2Necro: |
    - added XtargetHealing
    -- this allows for rezzing on xtarget if userez is on

9/22/2022:

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Fixed a new bug where we would try and cure everybuff.

8/10/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Corrected an issue where we would start pulling when we needed/wanted to memorize a buff spell
    -- this was a result of buff timer changes in july; fix'td's

8/08/2022:
  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Will now ignore "Form of Mana" when checking for triggered buffs
    -- this means we will now use our robe as offensive or burn clicky as expected if you have FoM blocked
  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Will now use GroupCureCorruption if memorized
    - No longer Canni AA if we are in safezone with revival sickness
    - We will still use if we have rez sickness

8/02/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Cleaned up some of the misc "Updated" messages to include the plugin output message
    - resetcamp will now clear our pull target if we had one previously
    -- example, you are in an area, and start to pull a mob, you manually move (paused or unpaused)
    --- after manually moving you hit resetcamp, before you will still go and pull that previously selected pull target
    --- now you will choose a new pull target upon resetting your camp

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Added "slowstick" - Serpent of Vindication.
    -- You will check to use this if you don't have slowing helix AA (and would otherwise be single slowing)

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Fixed tubmle/assassin's premonition usage when you don't have your aggro meter open
    -- this causes mq/eq to report incorrect info
    - Added Timer 2 deaggro usage if not tanking
    -- if you are tanking, mebbe get a real one?

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Wilting thorn added

  MQ2War: |

    - fixed an extra space in the autofire message

    - Made a check for spire of reavers so we don't try and use it if our buffs are full.
    -- y u have so many buffs raid-buffed sk?

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - We will now continue to dot mobs while in raidmode well past the normal health threshold where we would normally not waste the cast.

7/20/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Adjusted a situation where if we were memorizing a buff that has a long reuse timer on it, we wouldn't wait to check buffs again until it was done
    -- this is most noticable on   MQ2Enchanter: | with meleeauspice with raidmode on and during downtime
    - Added the ability for dispell clickies to be used in offensive or burn

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - added /enc removeauras to remove your aura buffs which can trigger a recast
    -- this is useful if you're using disempower aura and just want to be able to clear the auras so it recasts the totem where you are

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Corrected a self-cure issue that came to be 7 months ago =p

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Will now use Time's Antithesis if we don't have Turgur's Swarm AA
    -- this means you do *NOT* need to addclicky it
    -- We will check to use TA before checking for our slow spell, if TA is not ready (on cooldown) we'll check against our slow spell.
    -- There is no toggle for this as there is no need.
    - We will now continue to slow/malo mobs while in raidmode at a much much lower health value that not in raidmode.
    -- the idea was we don't care about slowing/maloing a mob that is already dead
    -- but for raid mobs, it would be important for that to be a much lower value

7/7/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixed an unforgivable UX issue with StandOnFeignAtHealth
    - Added a CWTN boolean member "Missing" ${CWTN.Missing} which tells us if we are missing any spells/discs
    -- i was being lazy and wanted to /dgae /dgtell all $\{CWTN.Missing} (or whatnot)

  MQ2Bst: |
    - now has an option to mgb before using paragon *while in raid*
    -- if you don't want to mgb paragon, leave it off

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Added Puratus

  MQ2Mage: |
    - XTargetBuffing

5/28/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Instead of not combat memorizing if we have something on cursor, we will not autoinventory.
    -- this is specifically because memorizing in combat has already said "yes we absolutely want to memorize this spell" in the routine,
    --- so we don't want to do nothing while we wait on the cursor
    - splashie target updates
    - deprecation adjustments

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - added new toggle for UseWardAA
    -- during burns if you have usecures on you will use ward of purity, if usecures off, exquisite benediction
    -- if you have usewardAA turned on, you will still use exquisite as an absolute dire emergency usage as a group heal

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - UseMelee defaulted to false
    - UseRegen defaulted to false (this is an issue in modern game, but many folks don't read the FAQ)

4/23/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Adjusted ChaseDistance default
    -- Healers and pure casters should be defaulted to 25
    --- This is helpful for "twitchy" drivers who move around too much which would prevent a caster/healer from starting to cast earlier than perhaps it needs to.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - fixed combatmemorize

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - If you have PromHealMA set to 100 (and only set to 100), we will now cast it when mobs are on xtarget
    -- if your ma is at 100 health and does not have the buff.
    --  this allows it to get in a promised healing, when the MA doesn't otherwise need healing, without interrupting normal healing like remedy usage.
    --- if you don't want to do this, don't set prom healing to 100
    -- looking at you burd "but i don't like this thing that im not forced to use" sjm

  MQ2Mage: |
    - fixed combatmemorize

  MQ2Monk: |
    - should no longer just insta smash mend upon zoning waiting for eq to realize you're alive
    -- I can't believe no one mentioned this, tho mend does come back fairly quickly



4/12/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - We will now clear target when going to use a familiar.
    -- This corrects an issue with ToL familiars that if you dont have a pet, requires an empty target.
    - Corrected issue where sometimes you would try and use an item on your cursor.
    -- Our function to inventory it wasn't working; tis fix'dt'd now
    - (already active fix) Corrected an issue where it would say you have rez/revival sickness if your buffslots were full.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Specified levels for the two "same name" abilities "Natural Cooperation"
    -- This means it will now output correct levels for the missing abilities if you hate your toons and are missing 3 tiers of spells.
    -  Removed some rando-debugs that were left in

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - InterruptForMez is now defaulted to "False".
    -- This is more problematic for current era, and more intended for early game/tlp.

  MQ2Mage: |
    - Handle all the stupid Iceflame Barricades
    -- Thx dbg

3/29/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Internal updates for checking selfbuffs to ensure we have room.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Cleanup.
    -- Added some spacing in the naming groups for readability.
    - Updated and future proofed Feralist's Unity.
    -- Coincidentally fixed the fact that it wasn't using the new ToL one from beta -> live.

  CWTN: |
    - We will now wait after a death and subsequent rez/revive before trying to use downtime clickies.
    - CWTN.Command for enchanter should now correctly return "Enc" instead of "End"
    - Plugins will now check to ensure your target matches your underwater value. IE: If you're bodywet, but mob isn't bodywet, then we won't use some abilitys.
    -- This will prevent chain casting some things that can't be used when those are different. "Liquid distorts your view" blah blah blah.
    - `Xetheg, Luclin's Warder` has been renamed `Xetheg, Luclin's Warden`

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Fixed duplicate entry for Frozen Chaos
    - Will now memorize mending (even with busemending off) if you don't have "Frozen" spell line.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Should now check stacking from the autocast caused by Chaotic line to ensure we're not conflicting with Improved Twincast.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Added Terror of Vergalid as a pullability to fill a gap from 71-72.

  MQ2Mage: |
    - You can now make the mag force cast the Modulation Shard AA with a "/mag modrod".
    -- This means you can have a hotkey on your driving toon or a react to "bct mage //mag modrod" or "/dex mage /mag modrod"
    --- and it would recast the AA reguardless if it personally had a modrod or not.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Intervention name for Antediluvian Interruption changed to Antediluvian Intervention.

  MQ2War: |
    - Will now fire our regular active discs (defense, etc) sooner.

1/17/2022:
  CWTN: |
    - Reworked the Gift of Mana logic so that spells will only fire for GoM if they have a level appropriate GoM for the spell to benefit from it.
    - All plugins have been updated to look for Gracious Gift of Mana from Enchanters, as was intended.
    - SwitchWithMA when the MA (or RA) is a corpse, will no longer force clear your target if the MA (or RA) is hovering, and no longer has a target (because you/raid killed it).
    - Fixed groupwatch output, and adjustment/setting with 0-4 options in the command line.
    - Some Unity updates to try and make sure we don't try and cast it when we don't quite have enough mana for it.
    -- the value the AA says it needs to cast is not actually the amount it needs.
    - We will no longer try to bash on FTP accounts if you have a prestige shield. We will instead let you know.
    - Some fixes to autoinventorying summoned items.
    - Fixed new issue with offensive/burn clickies firing willy nilly like!
    - Increased the delay from standing to sitting back down.
    -- This is intended to help for laggy servers that don't show you're casting a spell right away as it should
    --- for purposes of things like downtime clickies.
    - Added Umbral Raid nameds to our named checking (the bosses)
    - "MacroQuest" licenses are now the licenses that you get when purchased.
    -- Legacy, for as long as RG still has it, is what will end up waiting on a sync.
    -- MacroQuest, which was referred to as "Next" will no longer require a wait.
    --- Wahoo!

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Fixed a typo in tooltip for UseParagon, where it used to say Use Paragon of Spirits, it now says Use Paragon of Spirit.
    - Handle duplicate spell name for Spiritual Vigor. Thx dbg.
    - VelocityUnity Trigger adjustment.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Added "DIAll" option
    -- When you have UseDivineIntervention on, you can use DIAll to "keep divine intervention on everyone" and not just the MA, yourself,
    -- and the puller. It will still look at the MA, then yourself, then the puller, then everyone else
    --- this, of course, requires cwtnbuffs.
    -- Created CWTN type member for DIAll.
    - Fixed issue where QP wasn't firing.
    - We will no longer try and cross-group cure with WordCure.
    - We will no longer use rez stick in safe zones (like lobby).

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - AutoMezImmune will no long automatically add things to MezImmunes if it's just immune to that spell, and not completely immune.
    - We will no longer AoE Tash if your target has single tash on it. this is due to a rank/stacking misalignment in ToL :(
    - Fixed issue with huntertank mode not doing damage abilities unders certain cirucmstances.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Added "Iron Maiden" reverse DS to items to try and cure.

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Corrected issue where we would wait for rogue's fury to fade before using twisted.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - References to "Stance" has been renamed to Loadout.
    -- your ini entry will remain using "stance", but your window and such will show "loadout"
    -- you can continue to use /shm stance or /shm loadout to adjust, but references will be show "loadout"
    --- As before, "Loadout" is intended to adjust your spell loadout, not priority.
    --- You don't become a wizard because you turn on dps loadout.
    ---- "I'm not a wizard harry" - Shaman in dps loadout, probably.
    - We will no longer use rez stick in safe zones (like lobby).
    - Fixed a potential crash if you somehow had MaloDoT but didn't have one of the trigger spells.

  MQ2War: |
    - Added a "UseSnare" option to toggle usage of the "Call of Challenge" AA
    - (lower level) We will now cancel "stonewall discipline" if you are in pullerassist or pullertank (not hunter), and have no mobs on xtarget.

12/15/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Implemented changes that allow us to deferientiatioansdfaip;sdfja;sldkfja spells with different levels but the same name. There-fore any duplicates not mentioned below for released classes
    -- should be mentioned to us so we can handle them appropriately.
    - Fixed a named check for "Pli Xin Liako", which we had accidentally named "Pli Xin Laiko" - Which means we'll be automatically burning them in the Aten Ha Ra group mission (With burnallnamed on).
    - Added "Aten Ha Ra", "Shei Vinitras", "Fade", "Umber", "Keltakun, Last Word", and "Kratakel, Lord Misery" to our named checks.
    - We will no longer try to remove detrimental spells with invulnerability.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - (lower lvl) Handle duplicate spell name for Growl of the Leopard.

    - low lvl rez adjustment
    -- If you have no means to rez, then we won't continue to check and wait on those bodies

  MQ2Enchanter: |

    - Added Grant Shak Dathor's Armaments - and its weapons.
    -- While the spell itself was added we didn't have the details on which weapon was which ID's so could add the use of them.
    -- Thanx random person for summoning me a bag - Because nobody has updated the info about this spell and what it summons.
    - Will no longer take a step forward if you have usemelee off and are in a tank mode

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - low lvl rez adjustment
    - - If you have no means to rez, then we won't continue to check and wait on those bodies

  MQ2War: |
    - workaround for issue where our aura would now fail our stacking check despite not having the aura.

12/06/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Adjusted a raidmode check that would not buff Group_V1 spells to other groups.
    - Made adjustments to address the super duper lower level problem where if you were melee pulling and a mob was moving you would move up to it, and not quite turn on melee fast enough to attack.
    - We know check if you are "amnesia'd" for combat ability usage. (Next)
        - "showclickies" now shows if you did a "help" command ex: /clr help. (Next)
    - Fixed mounting usage check. (Next)
    - Standardized mez output colors. (Next)

    -- I know your 113 ranger pet is really sad about not having 50 mana and 2 mana regen, sorry =p.
    - Fixed crash at char select. (Next)

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Fixed issue where if you use /shd summonremains it wouldn't save correctly to your ini.
    -- (it was saving to summonremains, but looked at autosummonremains on start).

  MQ2Mage: |
    - Fixed ToL spells showing in "this is not a valid spell" before ToL was released.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Fixed issue where if you use /shd ResponsiveSpi (which is "overloaded" to match the window button), it wouldn't save correctly to your ini.
    -- (it would save to ResponsiveSpi, but load from ResponsiveSpirit)

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Will no longer wait for the buff from the fellstrike line to fade before reusing.
    - Corrected issue with StunStrike not firing when it should
    -- "smartified" stunstrike usage to make any changes or additions continue to work

11/17/2021:
  CWTN: |

  MQ2Mage: |
    -- Added functionality for AA and spell Coth
    --- /mag coth bob
    --- this will use the AA if you have it, or the spell if you don't have the AA and the spell is memorized
    -- /mag gcoth bob
    --- this will use the memorized spell "Call of the heroes"
    -> NOTE <-
    - You will still need to byos, or utilize something like turning off useSkinDS (makes your gem 9 empty) to memorize Coth if you want to use the memorized spell version
    -- (we skip the regular coth spell if you have the AA, but this would apply for the group coth, or pre-AA coth, for example).
    -- at least at this time, we're not memorizing it for you.


11/14/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Added AllianceBurnOnly as an option
    -- Will only use alliance during a burn condition
    --- This still requires usealliance/forcealliance to be set as expected.
    - Removed Forcealliance as an option for the priest classes as we don't check class count.
    - the "force alliance" button is now just inactive if you have alliance turned off instead of invisible.
    -- this helps with not having to adjust your window so there isn't a gap or overlapping buttons.
    - If we are in raidmode with a raidma assigned and they become a potential healing target for us (xtarget healing for example), we will treat them with MA heal values instead of non-MA healing values.
    -- This is only on the RaidMA that you assigned in your raidassist.
    -- This does not treat other Raid MAs who are *not* your assigned raidassist as MA.
    -- This will not treat Raid MAs as MA if you are not in raidmode (you wouldn't have a raidassist assigned anyhow).
    - Corrected issue where the CWTN dataype and their members would report incorrectly if swapping characters.
    - We will now only provide the option for BroadCast Mez on classes that we Mez with (currently enchanter).

    - Added missing "Unified Credence"

  MQ2Monk: |

    -- this allows you to toggle that off if you need/want to save it from being used during the tier'd burn routine.

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - In pullertank/pullerassist will now only do summon/downtime if we're in camp.
    - Removed Fatal / Deadly from our timer 16 usage.

    - Can now toggle off the automatic usage of Glyph Spray.

    -- derp.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - (Next) Corrected unreported issue with alliance check.

  MQ2Monk: |
    - Addressed situation where you have Distant Strike, but a 0 rank.

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Fixed potential character select crash.
    - Added "/rog debugcorpse on"
    -- it will report debug information from the corpse grabbing routine once.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Will now output your target if you're using a rez stick.
    - (Next) Will no longer try and squall if we don't have LoS on our squall target.
    - Updated lower lvl loadout to ensure we have mending loaded in gem1 if nothing else.
    - Updated to use HexDoT preferably over ColdDD where we can for gem 5.
    - (Next) Refactored Group Cure Checks.
    -- (Next) Cleaner, Faster, bettererest.

9/20/2021:
  CWTN: |

  MQ2Berzerker: |
    - Communion of Blood updates.
    -- No Communion of Blood in a safe zone.
    -- No Communion of Blood with revival sickness; rez sickness is fine.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Added some mid lvl spells to TargetRingAEMez
    -- they're not necessarily target "RING AEs"", but they fit the rest of the group.

  MQ2Mage: |
    - If you have ShieldOfFate usage turned on, and VeilDS is turned off, you will memorize ShieldOfFate in that slot, and re-apply during combat.

9/14/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixed an issue where you wouldn't bash if you were an SK with a 2 hander (unless innoruuk's curse) despite having Improved Bash.
    -- this is an eskay fix, but part of our utility functions library, that is why note is here also.
    - ${CWTN.RaidAssist} now reports the number you would expect
    - Added ${CWTN.RaidAssistName} - will report the RaidAsssit by name
    - Will now accommodate certain spells that don't actually have a spell category or sub category.
    -- specifically addresses circumstances where the "recourse" trigger for exceptional velocity gives a different spell than the "real" spell,
    --- and has a 0 cat / subcat which was resulting in a failure of our haste checking.
    - Corrected issue with Eradicate Magic firing if we had just targeted a friendly.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Fixed issue with spamming Velocity/Velocity Unity.
    -- We were accidentally checking raid and xtarget members for the autocast buff *your* group gets.
    - Moar haste value checking for usage of the autocast from Velocity/VelocityUnity.
    - The autocast usage of Velocity/VelocityUnity line for haste purposes now respects UseHaste.
    - Now has a toggle for UseHaste; /bst usehaste on/off/true/false/0/1
    -- Lower lvl you will use your STHaste spell.
    -- Higher lvl you will use VelocityUnity autotrigger.
    - Corrected issue where Ferociousness wouldn't fire after Savage faded, as expected.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Fixed an unreported issue that could occur in an assisting mode with alliance not firing because target swapping too frequently.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Added additional haste value checking for usage of haste.
    - Added "Mindcleave", "Mindscythe", and  "Mindblade" to the "synergy" spell group
    -- you don't get synergy until mindsunder, so the group name is a bit of a misnomer :)
    - Added fixes for tanking or huntertanking - y u do dis on enchanter :(
    - Added Doppelganger AA usage during burns.
    -- This is defaulted to OFF because it shadowsteps your toon when it uses it.
    --- turn this on at your own risk of shadowstepping you off-mesh or into badness.
    - Cleaned up usage of InterruptForMez.
    -- This means it should now only do the interrupt if it is able to and is going to mez.
    - Corrected issue with Eradicate Magic firing if we had just targeted a friendly.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Fixed an issue where you wouldn't bash if you were an SK with a 2 hander (unless innoruuk's curse) despite having Improved Bash.
    - Fixed a lower lvl bug where you would be like "nah, dude, I don't lifetap.".

  MQ2Mage: |
    - you can now adjust when you use Gather Capability line at
    -- /mag GatherCapabilityAt #
    - Fixed issue where you would spam swarm AA back to back, but it would fail because you cast another swarm pet too recently.
    - Updates to correct issue with retargetting mobs if you're huntertank or tank mode and you buff.
    - Fixed spelling error for "Annihilate the Aberrant".

    -- This respects UseHaste option.

    - Corrected issue trying to cast GroupCureAll cure on xtarget/raid members.

08/13/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixed issue where you would no longer clear your target / validate target if your MA had no target or was targeting themselves if you no longer had mobs on xtarget.
    -- Thank you Tibberu for reporting it being persistent on this when told it wasn't a bug =p; it was.
    - SwitchWithMa is defaulted "on" for fresh toons
    - Classes that don't allow for switchwithma adjustment, like our "caster" classes (mage, enchanter, cleric, shm, etc)
    -- will now clear their targets in melee if their assist clears their target or targets themselves (which is how it works for melee classes that utilize the switchwithma functionality)
    -- it was previously possible for this to cause issue if your MA got out of range before clearing target/targeting themselves. (should address Dunda's issue, thx Dunda)
    - Updates and corrections to how we were checking for best-in-group spells from AAs/Spells.
    - Updated tooltips about malo/slow/tash AoE usage.
    - Corrected issue with checking for your DoT on a mob if you had gone silver and had a rank II spell.
    - Corrected issue where a couple of the plugins wouldn't use burn clickies unless you were meleeing.
    - No longer try and incorrectly do stuff while shrouded.
    - Corrected issue where you wouldn't memorize a spell out of combat if your autoattack was on (some how).
    - UpdateWinTitle is now an adjustable setting - example: /shd UpdateWinTitle on/off/true/false/0/1 etc.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Corrected issue where you would cast paragon/fparagon while you had Focused Paragon of Spirit buff on you.
    - We will now cast at less than OR equal to your paragon/focusedparagon mana/endurance values instead of just less than.
    - SharedMercFerocity fix.
    - Fix't'd new sha issue.
    - GBA Cleanup and adjustment.
    -- We will now use GBA during Ferociousness, and not wait for it to fade.
    - We will no longer use Roar of Thunder whenever it is available in combat.
    - We will now use Roar of Thunder if the following conditions are met
    -- our aggro on the mob we're fighting is over 90
    -- or we're in a burn condition and the mob we're targeting is targeting us (we pulled aggro).
    --- this check is for Sub-RoF, before we get aggro information.
    - Added UseRoarOfThunder toggle.
    -- RoT can overwrite/block a necro dot line, which is dumb.
    - If we are "raid mode - /bst raidmode on - we will now use Tiger Claw instead of Eagle Strike.
    -- This is due to the potential for taking up additional debuff slots if you have multiple beastlords in your raid.
    - if your Velocity / VelocityUnity spell has a group trigger for group haste, and a melee in your group is missing it, we will fire Velocity/VelocityUnity
    -- we only cast these on non-pets out of combat.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Will now battle frenzy in burns if usenuke is on or in battlmode with usemelee turned on.
    - Added missing "Protection of Vie", lvl 54 spell.

    -- that you wouldn't target the mob to tash/slow.
    - Fixed issue where you would engage a mob out of camp if your MA was next to it.
    -- Mainly an issue for TLP where you might not have uber run speed and get back to the camp with enough time for a snack
    --- but you shouldn't be engaging a mob out of camp.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Corrected an issue where HPBuffTap would get recast when we did not need the recourse.
    - Check for stacking and buff slots for Gift of the Quick Spear and Scourge Skin.

    - UseMaloAoE now respects AoECount instead of >= 3.
    - You can now toggle usage of Fire Spells with /mag CastFire on/off etc.
    - You can now toggle usage of Magic Spells with /mag CastMagic on/off etc.
    -- These do NOT change your spell loadout.
    -- This is primarily to help lower level / TLP players who want to stop casting fire/magic spells while they are in a fire/magic resist/immune area
    --- and not have to go BYOS to change their spell loadout.
    - Added option "SelfPetWeaponsOnly" which will set it so you only give pet weapons to your own pet. Other pets in the group will be ignored.
    - Added UseDS toggle.
    -- This is for the DSSingle and DSGroupCircle Damage shield spell lines.
    - Fixed issue where you would engage a mob out of camp if your MA was next to it.
    -- Mainly an issue for TLP where you might not have uber run speed and get back to the camp with enough time for a snack
    --- but you shouldn't be engaging a mob out of camp, despite tlp or otherwise.
    - Added "SummonedNuke" with the Obliterate the xxx line of spells for BYOS purposes.
    -- We don't automem this spell, as mentioned for BYOS purposes.
    -- This spell isn't going to consume your Twincast/burns, it is just general usage.

  MQ2Monk: |
    - We will no longer cast our aura in safezones.

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Will no longer use FellStrike, if your fellstrike ability is "elbow strike" and you are over lvl 19.
    -- This is so it doesn't chew up your timer 9.
    -- This will almost exclusively be for folks who are 20-85 in level where your "fellstrike" ability is still "elbow strike".

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Avatar usage fix. (this is already in the 7/22/2021 patch)
    - UseMaloAoE now respects AoECount instead of >= 3.
    - UseSlowAoE now respects AoECount instead of >= 3.
    - Corrected issue in our "Preincarnation" check that would, cause pulling issues.
    -- Yes that sounds crazy.
    - We will now use non-component consuming versions of Avatar during downtime,
    -- This means that "Ferine Avatar", "Ancient: Feral Avatar", and "Primal Avatar" will now be cast both in and out of combat,
    -- and "Avatar" will still only be cast during combat due to the component.
    - Will now Rez MA before the rest of the group.

7/21/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixed a TriggerSpell issue that would cause issue with "Channeled Mark" series.
    - Fixed an issue if you had a 100 radius, but a 5000 zradius (high/low) causing you to use a 100 sized sphere instead.
    -- this fixes trying to pull something like a vertical tower. (Thanks Rusang).
    - Addclicky will not tell you what item is on your cursor if you try and add something that is an invalid addlicky.
    - GroupNeedBuff will now always check for reagent need, and ensure we have reagents before returning that someone needs the buff.
    -- This helps cover wild-and-crazy low lvl spells that have random reagent requirements for no reason.
    -- "Unity" AA spell updates to address changes.
    - Updated named checks in PoP Crypt of Decay.
    - Updated named checks in SoV Kael.
    - Updated named checks in SoV Sleepers.
    - Fixed issue where the achievement ".49999%" would crash you to desktop without a .dmp file.
    - Fixed an issue where you would try and use your opener if you had UseOpener on in a puller mode.
    - We will now turn on autoconsent of group, guild, and fellowship when the plugins load.

  MQ2Bst: |

    -- this brings in line with other plugins that have a group shrink option.
    - MercFero overwrite fixes/updates.
    - Cleaned up a wild-bracket in blood usage.
    - Will no longer use our DFury if we have another already on us.
    -- Meaning if a there is another bst in the group and they cast Composite, we won't cast it if we still have that buff.
    - Added Companion's Shielding
    -- it will use it as an additional emergency pet heal
    -- it will also use it as an emergency "uh oh" if our health gets at or below 30%

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Fixed a TriggerSpell issue that would cause issue with "Channeled Mark" series.
    - Moved the "Shielding" buff check as an earlier priority.
    -- This is useful for non-"Saint's Unity" owners, like on TLP, to ensure we're getting regen sooner than later.
    - Removed "SwitchWithMA" as it isn't an option that has ever been used.
    - Cleric can now use nukes and damage shields without being in melee combat.
    -- huzzah
    - We will only go to assist/target the enemy mob if we're going to do something to it.
    - Now if you have MemSplash you will also memorize Unyielding TwinDD line and try and pair twinncast healing procs with it.
    -- TwinDD usage does require UseNuke turned on.
    -- We don't "wait" on anything, so there it isn't going to "hold on heals until we can twincast the splash", but it looks to pair it if/when it can.
    - The standard spell load out does not have any nukes in it at max level, some lower lvls might.
    -- You can byos nukes (the nukes the plugin reports it is going to use), and it will assist and nuke as expected.
    - Will now use Seventeenth line, and correctly, in both byos and non byos mode. (lul)
    - If UseDivineIntervention is on, we will now also keep DI on local characters who are assigned the "Puller" role in your group window.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Orator's Unity update.
    - Lower/Mid level gem fill-in.
    -- This helps cover some of the gaps in the 70s-80s as you start to get Mnemonic Retention.

    - No longer outputting "SingleStun" as it isn't something the plugin uses.

    - Fixed issue where we would recast Bite of Tashani where we didn't need to.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Added missing "Plague of Zlandicar" from the DoTPlague spell lineup.

  MQ2Mage: |
    - Will no longer hand out +Hate/Aggro pet weapons.
    -- this may change in the future for if we're tanking, or another pet class is the MA but not at this time.
    - PetHeal is now a value you can adjust with /mag petheal #
    -- the previous values would heal your pet differently if it was the target of the mob you're fighting, or just taking dmg
    --- now it will all be based off of your petheal value, so adjust the value to how you would like to use it.
    -- PetHeal value is purely for your "PetHeal", mend companion etc is still handled internally.
    - Added ShockCombo usage.
    - Moving VeilDS to our Misc Gem slot (8).
    - Gem6 if we're tanking will be petblock, otherwise Shock.
    - We will now cast DSSingle on tank-class pets.
    - Added Shield of the Elements.
    -- Will trigger at 30% health or lower (no requirement for mobs on xtarget)

    - Added Heart of Froststone.
    -- Will trigger at 30% health or lower with mobs on xtarget
    -- Might need a toggle?
    - Will now use Firebound/Paradox while burning even if you have twincast.
    - Fixed a missing UseSwarmPet check for a swarm pet usage.
    - Fixed issue trying to hand pet weapons to the lvl 55 druid "boo-boo" pet
    -- This pet only has a right arm, and thus, can only take 1 weapon.
    - Will now use GoM to cast your Dicho/Dissi/Composite companion.
    - Corrected issue where Firebound wouldn't fire if you were in a tanking mode.
    - Enhancements for pet tanking while you have usemelee off.
    - Servant of Ro will now match all usage of Host of the Elements.
    -- There were times when lower level you would use HotE, but not SoR, which is now corrected.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Removed "SwitchWithMA" as it isn't an option that has ever been a usable option.
    - Will no longer try and memorize "Scale Skin" or similar spells if we don't have the reagents for them.
    - AutoAssistAt 100 now works as intended.

  MQ2War: |
    - Misc Cleanup.
    - Will now observe our on-zone delay before checking downtime clickies.
    -- this is to address users who die, revive, get rezzed, and start clickin before their xtarget is populated, due to lag/game/fps.

6/22/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Corrected an issue with our trigger checking from buffs.
    -- this potentially fixes some outlier buffs that say they can stack but don't.
    - Corrected issue with our reagent check.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Added the SlowSpell line to be used for our pulling ability if we don't have Sha's Reprisal.
    -- As usual you can turn this off if you want to by turning DisablePullAbility on.
    - Keep in mind, we stop memorizing SlowSpell at lvl 90 once we get Maelstrom, we no longer memorize slow spell.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Fixed an issue where some buffs were done from the "wrong" gem slot.
    - Fixed memorization issue during lower levels reported by hammackj and iliketurtles.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Added GH BuffBot to   MQ2Enchanter: |
    -- Current options are:

  MQ2Mage: |
    - Will no longer use Orb/Paradox during normal twincast.
    - Will no longer display SwitchWithMA in the UI.
    - Shock line will now cast if it's memorized.
    - Fixed typo in PetStance line.
    - AA ModRod, Self ModRod, Paradox, Servant, and Minion lines now all check for you to

    -- added a toggle for these. UseMinion and UseServant

    - Will use Host in the Shell AA if our pet has aggro from our target.
    - Will now keep up "Second Wind Ward" AA on our pet.
    - Corrected an issue with "Thaumaturge's Unity" AA also memorizing the spell when you don't need.
    - Corrected issue with our Reagent check, which caused lower lvl earth pet to fail summoning.
    - Added Malo spell lineup, and memorization at lower lvl.
    -- You need UseMalo turned on.
    - Added additional spells to memorize at lower levels.
    - Will no longer try to give pet weapons to familiars.
    - Hungry/Thirsty mages will now summon food/water.

    - Add Paradox to Gem 13 if UseAlliance is off.

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Rogue will can now use throw stone as a pull ability.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Fixed an issue where GroupCureAll was being used to cure a curse while blood of nadox or blood of avoling.
    - thanks for the report/info Raiden1

6/13/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Upon plugin load, we will now ensure your xtarget window is setup to auto-populate.
    - Updated our needbuff check while in a raid.
    -- This includes any spell that is "Single in group", like Boon of the Garou.
    - EQ/MQ2 sometimes has a bug where it thinks you have something on XTarget, even tho you don't.
    -- If we detect that is true, we will reset the xtarget slot that is "ghosted".
    - "Mercifucl Shield" addclicky burn usage:
    -- If you have a "Merciful Shield" item added to your burn addclicky, you will now target your MA before usage.
    - We will no longer try and pull a mob that doesn't have a name.
    - We should now recognize the named "a shrouded bat" as a named, and not the ph "a shrouded bat" a named.
    - Will now output (GoM) in green next to spell names where GoM applies to it when casting.
    - Will now autoinventory items before we try to use them if the item is on the cursor.
    -- This is useful if you have a modrod on addclicky, and it's freshly summoned and your low on mana
    -- before it would spam click it while it was on the cursor until it wasn't. Now it will bag it, then use it.

  MQ2Berzerker: |
    - Should once again only use glyph when burning.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - CombatSummonPet is now defaulted to off.
    - We no longer will check CombatState for combatsummon routine, only xtargets.
    -- this will fix a situation that can occur if someone has an out-dated or just wrong player window.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - "Mercifucl Shield" addclicky burn usage:
    -- If you have a "Merciful Shield" item added to your burn addclicky, you will now target your MA before usage.
    - We will only memorize 1 remedy heal if you are below lvl 86.
    -- sub 86 remedy line spells reuse is the same as recovery, so you end up not being able to use more than 1 with any real meaning.
    -- this will now just memorize 1 remedy if we're below lvl 86, and memorize the light heal line in the next slot.
    --  remedy is Quick Heals, and Light is HealsHeals, so you could adjust your healing values accordingly, and get value from each gem slot.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - We will no longer try and Boon of the Garou raid members who are not in our group.
    - We will no longer pester you about your epic 1.5/2.0 as we don't automagically use it anyhow.
    - Enchanter will now opt to use Chromanuke instead of spamming Breathing DoT if the dmg from the nuke
    -- of ChromaNuke is higher than the Breathing DoT. We will still cast the Breathing DoT line
    -- to put the DoT on the target.
    - Should once again only use glyph when burning.
    - Using UseEradicate in the UI will now actually work.
    - Added ${CWTN.UseEradicate}, ${CWTN.TashThenMez}, ${CWTN.InterruptForMez}

  CWTN: |
    - Corrected issue that would cause some classes to re-apply AAs when not needed.

    - Emu: buffstacking updates.
    - Emu: fixed some emu specific buffing issues.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Corrected a Food/Summon issue where you would alternate memorizing and summoning 1 food and 1 drink.
    - MercFero will now check for other ranks of the buff.
    -- This should correct overcasting a different rank due to how it is reported they stack.
    - Added nukemanamin.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Will no longer try and "Boon of the Garou" on XTarget when useXTargetBuffing is turned on.

    -- TY Searlas and eqplayer for the report.
    - Will now do DPS in huntertank mode.
    - Added missing CheckBuffsTimer.
    - made the iMiscGemSlot for easier buff changing/editing.

5/19/2021:

    - Fixed an issue that was causing AA's to respect GCD when they shouldn't have.
    - Workaround for mq2 issue related to active campfire in instances.

  MQ2Cleric: |

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Lupine Spirit AA fix.
    - Added "Tiny Terror" to Shrink spell group.
    - Various additional cleanup.
    -- Cleaned up some buff checking to happen after verifying we need it and it is available.
    --- This further reduces our checks in our buff file if we don't need that information right this moment.

5/10/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Corrected unreported issue where the "visibility state" of the CWTN UI window (shown / unshown) didn't save between sessions.
    -- This means if you close your window, and log out, it won't pop back up unless you ask it to.
    -- So if this has been happening to you, you're not crazy, and its not your fault.
    - AddClicky ManaSelf: Can now safely use mana conversion items without fear of trying to chain cast if the
    -- conversion would result in your death. (Mod Rods, Manastone, Mana Robe etc)
    - The Eradicate Magic check will now skip buffs that are "No Dispell".
    - We will no longer cast reflectable spells on mobs that have a 100% or greater reflect.
    - Fixt an issue where if your MA was a pet class, and they sent their pet in, UseMelee toons could yoyo
    -- back and forth from the MA and the target mob until AssistAt was met.
    -- (primarily noticable in ChaseAssist). It was also forcing a face of the mob. Both issues have been corrected.
    - ShrinkGroup clickies will now check if you an intended recipient has that spell blocked.
    -- This means you can use a shrinkgroup clicky to shrink your whole group, but if one of them has the shrink blocked, it won't try and shrink them.
    - Corrected issue that mainly affects Duration heals which was intended to check the buff status before casting it via cwtnbuffs.
    -- This mainly affects Duration heals, as we intend to check for the status of that buff (if you have it, is it blocked, etc.).

  MQ2Berzerker: |
    - Turns out MQ2Berzerker never checked downtime clickies, or aura in between pulls in a pulling mode.
    -- Fix't
    - Added ${CWTN.UseOpener} to check if useopener is on or not.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Fixed an issue where we would autoinventory coin.
    -- Don't ask. :p

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Internal Cleanup
    - Adjusted some extra unnecessary buff checking.
    -- This helps lower additional mq2cwtnbuff file reads.
    - Fixed an issue where we would autoinventory coin.
    -- Don't ask. :p
    - Rezzing on XTarget players now correctly checks range for /corpse.
    - Corrected issue that mainly affects Duration heals which was intended to check the buff status before casting it via cwtnbuffs.
    -- This mainly affects duration heals, as we intend to check for the status of that buff (if you have it, is it blocked, etc.).

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Added Tranquility to our GroupManaRegen.
    - Corrected issue where you wouldn't do your combat dps in manual mode.
    -- the manual/vs assist modes are more intended for when usemelee is on.
    -- we *should* have been doing stuff in manual mode, and will now.
    - The Eradicate Magic check will now skip buffs that are "No Dispell".
    - Corrected issue where you could potentially try casting "Mana Replication" when you were trying to cast "Mana Replication Aura"
    - Removed SwitchWithMa as casters are going to re-aquire target from the MA if they swapped to do something like a buff/mez/etc.
    - UseEradicate option.
    - Options output typo correction.

  MQ2Monk: |
    - Will no longer fire EndRegen if you have revival sickness (will still fire with rez sickness).
    - Breaths line will no longer fire in a safe-zone or if you have revival sickness.
    - Turns out MQ2Monk never checked downtime clickies, or aura in between pulls in a pulling mode.
    -- Fix't :tm:

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Turns out MQ2Rogue never checked downtime clickies, or reflxes in between pulls in a pulling mode.
    -- Fix't :tm:
    - Added timer 9 "opener" as an option with /rog useopener.
    -- this is more useful in the 25 to mid 80s range than for high level, as it shared timer 9.
    -- for this to actually fire you should be using /rog usehidesneak on.
    --- it won't prevent you from getting into combat if you are not hide/sneaking, but it will not fire (and try to).
    - Added ${CWTN.UseOpener} to check if useopener is on or not.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Internal Cleanup
    - Adjusted some extra unnecessary buff checking.
    -- This helps lower additional mq2cwtnbuff file reads.
    - Corrected an issue where trying to cure curses with Blood of Nadox and Blood of Avoling.
    - Fixed an issue where we would autoinventory coin.
    -- Don't ask. :p
    - Rezzing on XTarget now correctly checks range for /corpse.
    - Corrected issue that mainly affects Duration heals which was intended to check the buff status before casting it via cwtnbuffs.
    -- For MQ2Shaman this mainly affects halcyon, as we intend to check for the status of that buff (if you have it, is it blocked, etc.).
    -- This behavior was already correct for things like RenewalHoT.

  MQ2War: |
    - Turns out MQ2War never checked downtime clickies, or aura in between pulls in a pulling mode.
    -- Fix't :tm:

4/25/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Fix't GHBuffBot possible crash (unreported, but still possible).
    - Added some clarity to groupwatch output (Starting and Ending).

    - fix't issue where the "we're now group watching should we continue to do so" check for cleric was *missing*

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - internal cleanup.
    -- includes fixing a couple of odd-ball checks in our memspells portion
    -- you may or may not see seventeenth in a different slot than before, etc.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - moved our "This is a pet, and their idle animation is 110..." to debug
    -- thanks for the report, Drac, sorry for the spam.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - Voice of Thule AA will now check for stacking.
    -- This doesn't fix any issue, but future proofs it.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Despite being upside down in the future our buddy, Hylander found a spelling mistake.
    -- I have "disabed" the mistake. ;)
    -- it is now fix't.
    - Added UseAttentiveSpirit as its own thing
    -- this stacks with ResponsiveSpirit

04/21/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixt potential issue with shrinkclickies actin` up.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Changed our FD usage to check if you are tanking (in a tank mode or assigned as group main tank) instead of just checking what mode you are in.
    -- this is important, because you may be manual mode, but assigned as MT, and you don't want to FD in that case.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Added a toggle for "KeepHoTUp"
    -- if you have a hot/grouphot memorized, and have keephotup on, and you have mobs on xtarget, you're going to try and keep hot/grouphot up at all times.
    - Will no longer cast "Word of Restoration" once to try and cure curse - it doesn't have curse cure yet.

  MQ2Monk: |
    - Changed our FD usage to check if you are tanking (in a tank mode or assigned as group main tank) instead of just checking what mode you are in.
    -- this is important, because you may be manual mode, but assigned as MT, and you don't want to FD in that case.

04/13/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Fixt a check for decapitate when user is using mq2headshot.
    -- this gives mobs a "last name", which we normally try and avoid while pulling.
    --- this allows if mq2headshot is used and it has the last name of "Decapitate", that we don't ignore them for purposes of pulling.
    - Updated some Addclicky and target swapping logic so you should no longer try and target someone to cure with a clicky and then change target back quickly.

  MQ2Berzerker: |
    - Fixt a check for decapitate when user is using mq2headshot (as referenced for ALL).

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Added "Friendly Pet" to the Convivial Warder line.
    - Added Summon Food/Water.
    -- /bst SummonFoodDrink true/false/0/1/off/on.

    - Added GHBuffBot to   MQ2Cleric: |
    - GHBuffBot - Turns on the "Guild Hall Buff Bot"
    - GHBuffSilent - if On will not ever output a reply with the buffme information
    - GHBuffGuildOnly - if On will require the person requesting buffs is ALSO a member of your guild. We already require them to be in the same zone as you, and within 50 range of you, but this adds an additional layer of protection/security.
    - BuffRequestPhrase=buffme - this can be changed to any single word - /clr buffrequestphrase gimmedagoods then you would /tell cleric gimmedagoods GroupAegolism

    - Usage:
    - /tell cleric buffme
    - cleric will reply with available buff types and information on how to request buffs

    - You can request a spell by MQ2Cleric spell group
    -- Options are: Symbol, GroupSymbol, Aegolism, GroupAegolism, Vie, GroupVie,
    -- Group buffs": GroupAllAego, GroupAllSymbol
    -- "Low Lvl buffs": HPBuffGroup, HPBuffST
    --- Example: /tell cleric buffme GroupAllAego
    ----   MQ2Cleric: | will add Group Aegolism then buff them with that spells.

    - You can request GroupAllAego
    --- Example: /tell cleric buffme GroupAll
    ---- MQ2Cleric will add Group Aegolism, and Group Vie for the requester, and then buff them with those spells.

    - You can also request a spell by name.
    -- Example: /tell cleric buffme endure poison
    --- MQ2Cleric will verify that they have a spell "endure poison", that it is a viable spell to cast on another, and then load it and cast upon the requester.

  MQ2Monk: |
    - Internal FD "cleanup".
    -- Should resolve a potential issue not FDing.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Updated our SoW/Lupine Spirit check for circumstances where the movement speed you get from your SoW and your Lupine Spirit are the same
    -- despite casting different spells. Thanks Mortanio.
    - Added Turgur's Swarm as PullAA.
    -- If you don't have Turgur's Swarm, it will use your Malo spell as PullAbility (has to be memorized in your loadout to use it to pull).
    - If you have disablepullability, then you pull with melee as usual.

  MQ2War: |
    - Adjusted Aura check.
    -- this fixes potential issue if your emu has "old" spell information and spells "Myrmidons Aura" missing the apostrophe in your aura window.
    - Put an additional xtarget check in downtime routine.
    -- This should try and help users with high latency / slow server repsonse on rez.

03/31/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Progressive spell preference now uses this order:
    -- "comp 6, 5, 4, 3, dissi 6, 5, comp 2, dissi 4, comp 1, dissi 3, 2, 1, dicho" with a change to composite 2 over dissi 4
    --- there are mostly minor secondary reasons why composite 2 is better than dissi 4 - but improvements non-the-less.
    - Corrected typo in ReportAssist ini entry.
    -- Thank you Hylander for the Aassist.
    - Pet Shrink Clickies (like earrings or Curious Companion Compactor) will now only try and shrink your pet if added to ShrinkGroup.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Cleaned up a spell loadout issue for suuuuuper low lvl.
    - Corrected a lvl 1 buffing issue.
    - fixed where it was intended to allow byos to selected composite over dissident if for some reason you didn't want to use the dynamically chosen spell.

03/24/20201:
  CWTN: |
    - We have added additional logic to try and help stagger clickies that give group buffs or give you an aura.
    -- Examples: Unified Phoenix Feather and Rage of Rolfron.
    -- We still don't actively track or wait on another group member to do anything.
    -- We still say "are we supposed to click our item, is it ready, am i missing the buff from it?"
    --- if those are met, we click the item.
    -- this additional logic will try and help stagger group members for specific items that give group buffs or drop an aura on the ground.
    --- it will help, but its still possible for characters to end up meeting their conditions at the same time and cast at the same time.
    - Fixed a Group need buff issue that would cause headache when trying to use a buff of Single Target type.
    - We will now "unload noauto" MQ2Combat on characters using CWTN plugins.
    -- This plugin causes undesired behavior.

    -- Turning this off will no longer try and automatically add mobs to mez immune.
    - Enchanter should no longer interrupt Tash spells/AAs when InterruptForMez and TashThenMez is both on.
    - Fixed not remembering which aura's we had selected previously.

  MQ2Eskay: |
    - BYOS will no longer prevent you from using AutoSummonRemains AA.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Added a "GHBuffBot" Option
    -- GHBuffBot - Turns on the "Guild Hall Buff Bot"
    -- GHBuffSilent - if On will not ever output a reply with the buffme information
    -- GHBuffGuildOnly - if On will require the person requesting buffs is ALSO a member of your guild. We already require them to be in the same zone as you, and within 50 range of you, but this adds an additional layer of protection/security.
    -- BuffRequestPhrase=buffme - this can be changed to any single word - /shm buffrequestphrase gimmedagoods then you would /tell shaman gimmedagoods GroupFocus

    -- Usage: /tell shaman buffme
    --- shaman will reply with available buff types and information on how to request buffs

    -- You can request a spell by   MQ2Shaman: | spell group
    --- Options are: STFocus, GroupFocus, Sow, Regen, GroupRegen, Haste, GroupHaste, STAgi, GSta, GStr, GAgi, STAc

    --- Example: /tell shaman buffme feet like cat
    ---- Shaman will verify that they have a spell "feet like cat", that it is a viable spell to cast on another, and then load it and cast upon the requester.

03/13/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - For Necromancer, Mage, and Enchanters who are set to MA's, we will now use their pet's distance from the MA's target to determine if we should engage.
    -- instead of not engaging because the MA is a ranged pure caster with a pet tanking. The pet is still expected to be within melee range from the mob.
    - /blah UseStick off/on will now save to the appropriate ini section.
    - Debugpull will now also spit out mob's ID.
    - Debpugpull now has some colors for easier reading.

  MQ2Bst: |

03/08/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - Updated DoT Checks to check for *our* dots on a mob, and not just "any dot" that matched our dot's name.
    -- this required code addition to mq2 main.
    - our "safe zones" checks will ignore instanced Plane of Tranquility.
    - Downtime clickies, if they are "Target Type Single" we will target ourselves to cast it.
    -- Mainly lower lvl / TLP items like Lodi boots.
    -- We currently do not have an option to use items like this on others.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Lower lvl buffs (STAc, STDex, etc.) will no longer be cast upon higher lvl characters.

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Burn usage of Ward of Purity will respect UseCure.

  MQ2Enchanter: |
    - Updated UseSanguineAt message to reflect it us used at a health value and not a mana value.
    - UseTashAoE addition which uses Bite of Tashani AA.
    -- This means you can toggle off single Tash and only use the AoE Tash AA if you like.
    - UseSlowAoE addition which uses Envoloping Helix AA.
    -- This means you can toggle off single Slow and only use the AoE Slow AA if you like.
    - Spellgem adjustments.
    -- If UseTash is off (the single target), we will memorize ChromaNuke in gem1.
    - Fixed an Issue where you didn't have Slowing Helix AA, but were high enough level to need/want to memorize multiple of your Synergy line spells.
    -- This fixes the Mindslash/Mindsunder swapping spam at 110 if you don't have your Slowing Helix AA.
    - Added Constriction for when we don't have anything else and we're already using the chromanuke.

  MQ2Shaman: |
    - Fixed issue where in raidmode we would keep checking for raid corpses instead of buffing.
    - Corrected missing UseRezCall slash command.
    - Adjusted epic writeout.

02/26/2021:
  CWTN: |
    - StickHow has been replaced with StickSelection, with StickHow0 - StickHow9 options available.
    -- AS ALWAYS the "stickhow" options are only for during an assist mode.
    -- The default for "castery" classes has been updated to be more functional for castery classes
    -- AS ALWAYS Do not use percent signs in the stickhow listings, unless you double percent it like: 55%%.
    --- You will crash otherwise.
    -- So if are currently using a custom StickHow you will want to ensure you go and update your StickHow0. Since the StickSelection is 0.
    -- There are now (10), yes that many, StickHow0-StickHow9, options you can pre-define in your settings ini.
    -- The UI window now has a dropdown for stickselection choice
    -- you can also swap with slash command /zerk stickselection 2
    - The Ignores tab of the UI now has buttons to add/remove mobs from your Pull Ignores and your Mez Immune lists
    -- You can target a mob and click "Ignore Target" or "MezImmuneTarget" to add them to the respective lists.
    -- You can select a mob entry on the corresponding box on the left and click "Unignore Selection" or "UnMezImmune Selection" to remove.

  MQ2Berzerker: |

  MQ2Bst: |

    --- Clicking this "PAUSED" icon will unpause you.

  MQ2Bst: |
    - Adjusted Buff Check Timer.

  MQ2Monk: |

  MQ2War: |
    - FDisc will now be treated as a burn for lower lvl and not as a "fallback if nothing else available".

    - ChaseDistance addition.
    -- users can specifify the distance at which they would like to nav to the MA during chasemode.

    - Puller modes will return to camp and chill if you have rez sickness.
    - Extra and redundant checks to try and catch and then "beep" at users who's spellbook is reporting incorrectly to mq2 due to low frames.
    -- We already check with mq2 to see if mq2 sees the window - but we're going to also check for the physical window.
    -- if the physical window is open and mq2 can't see it, we're going to stand you up, warn you and /beep.
    --- This of course, relies on mq2 seeing the physical window. So again, please don't run automation software with min background fps.

    - Buffstack checking - should fix issue that happens with mercenaries.

    - /classshortname debugpull on once - will now output a debug for one iteration of checking for a pulltarget including if they are within the pullarc.
    - PullArc checks are now done before PathExists in an effort to reduce checking for a path on spawns that you won't be pulling anyway.
    - PullArc checks are now only done if PullArc is not 360.
    - Fix the timer for retrying to get a pulltarget if you failed to get a pulltarget. It wasn't being set correctly. This fixes some lag issues

    - Added some extra spells to mem if you're outside of "modern era".

  MQ2Cleric: |
    - Will no longer spam low lvl hp buff on group members who are not in our kissbuffs file (like real people on other computers).

    - Heal Routine has been refactored to improve cpu usage.
    - XTargetHealing will no longer attempt to heal pets. It was causing the cleric not to heal at all unless the pet was also added to

  MQ2Rogue: |
    - Add Cherliaealkcea or something like that.....it's the Asp Disc line, to the rogues DPS routine. No idea how it was missed. Apologies.

3/27/2020:
  CWTN: |
    - Plugins with windows can now set their assist input box to 100
    - Fixed a bug with memorizing spells that would cause the spell book to get stuck open and would just sit and wait for you to finish memorizing.

    - Now checking to see if you have a debuff for "Entrall" (SPA 31) on you that would prevent you from doing an AA/Cast/CombatAbility/UseItem
    - Fixed some outputs that were going to the MQ2Window that should have gone to the plugin's window.

    - Missing a disc or spell will now tell you if it's a disc or spell when you first load the plugin and have missing things. (SK has both so can be annoying to try and figure out which one it is if you're not using Scribe.mac)
    - If you were unable to find a mob within your pull radius and you are waiting for valid mobs, the plugins will now wait 1 second before looking again. this will prevent some of the mentioned "intermitten screen stalling" that was brought up... I hope.

    - Fix incorrect order of the GroupWatch help output for Healer and Healer and Crowd Control.
    - Fix bash trying to fire when dual weilding due to logic error in "ICanBash()" function. (Most obvious in   MQ2War: |).
    - Add CampOverlapBuffer option for all plugins which is used for any tank mode. This has already been part of all the tank
    - modes, but now you can alter the value. The value can be between 0 and 40, it allows you to account for camps not lining
    - up. You can set everyones campradius the same, and this will make additional considerations for group members who are on the
    - edge of the campradius getting aggro. The initial purpose of this was if you were in tank mode and waiting for incoming, but
    - bard or cleric got aggro on inc, and they were near the edge of the camp it was possible the mob could be hitting them from
    - just outside of the camp. The default value for this is 30. Which would cover some overlapping camp radius, the distance from
    - the spawn they are hitting, and their melee distance. This allows the tank to engage a mob who has engaged your group, but hasn't
    - and - won't ever enter camp without proper interferance by a member of the group. If you've been fine with the way it's been so far,
    - leave it at the default value. This option was primarily added for dungeons or tight quarters so that you can reduce it, or remove it.
